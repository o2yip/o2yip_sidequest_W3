## Description

This p5.js project demonstrates a simple multi-screen game structure using a state-based approach. The example includes a start screen, an instructions screen with a back button, a basic game screen, and win/lose outcome screens. The focus is on showing how to separate screens into different files, route input based on the current game state, and design simple UI elements such as buttons and keyboard controls.
This game demonstrates a forest game where users determine their own path. The user can select between 2 paths, one leading to good and one leading to bad. The "good" path allows users to move forward while the "bad" one leads them to losing a life. If users lose all 3 lives, they automatically lose the game. However, if they still have 1 or more lives reamining by the end of the multi-select screens, they win and escape the forest. Users can regain lives by choosing a "good" path, after losting a life.

## Learning Goals

- Understand how to manage multiple game states using a shared currentScreen variable
- Practice separating code across multiple files for readability and maintenance
- Implement clickable and keyboard-accessible UI buttons
- Learn how to route draw(), mousePressed(), and keyPressed() logic based on the active screen
- Build a basic instructions screen with a functional back button
- Change basic pass/fail game into more complex game with decisions
- Used storytelling within a game
- Implement hearts in a game to represent lives
- Adjusted different sections of codes to create a final game
